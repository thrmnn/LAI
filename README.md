# LAI
Automatic Tree Inventory from Remote Sensing integrating Leaf Area Index (LAI) estimation.

## Description
This project focuses on mapping the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and morphology of urban trees in Amsterdam using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and satellite imagery. The research is conducted at MIT SCL research lab, aiming to provide insights into urban forestry and environmental management.

## Dataset
Intermediate Results (~2k Trees)

The dataset used in this project is available on Hugging Face. You can access it [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Theozinh0/LAI_UrbanTrees_Amsterdam).

## Coming Soon
